## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of recursion to traverse a complex JSON structure and display the data hierarchically in the console. The primary objective is to develop a nested JSON structure and implement a recursive function in JavaScript to iterate through this structure.

### JSON Structure
A nested JSON structure is used to represent hierarchical tasks, including global tasks, tasks, and subtasks, each with its attributes like title, priority, and completion status.

### Recursive Traversal
A JavaScript function recursively traverses the JSON structure, displaying the tasks in a hierarchical format in the console. This approach ensures that all nested levels of tasks are processed and displayed correctly.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the application.
3. The JSON data is fetched from `data/tasks.json`, and the hierarchical task list is displayed on the webpage.
4. The console will also log the hierarchical structure of tasks for verification and debugging purposes.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `scripts/script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching the JSON data, recursive traversal, and displaying the task list.
- `styles/styles.css`: CSS file for styling the task list display.
- `data/tasks.json`: JSON file containing the nested structure of tasks.
